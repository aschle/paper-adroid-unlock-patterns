  title = {Anaerobic degradation of acetone and higher ketones via carboxylation by newly isolated denitrifying bacteria},
  volume = {135},
  issn = {0022-1287},
  abstract = {Five strains of Gram-negative denitrifying bacteria that used various ketones as sole carbon and energy sources were isolated from activated sludge from a municipal sewage plant. Three strains are related to the genus Pseudomonas; two non-motile species have not yet been affiliated. All strains grew well with ketones and fatty acids (C2 to C7), but sugars were seldom utilized. The physiology of anaerobic acetone degradation was studied with strain BunN, which was originally enriched with butanone. Bicarbonate was essential for growth with acetone under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, but not if acetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate were used as substrates. An apparent Ks value of 5.6 mM-bicarbonate was determined for growth with acetone in batch culture. The molar growth yield was 24.8-29.8 g dry cell matter (mol acetone consumed)-1, with nitrate as the electron acceptor in batch culture; it varied slightly with the extent of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) formation. During growth with acetone, 14CO2 was incorporated mainly into the C-1 atom of the monomers of the storage polymer PHB. With 3-hydroxybutyrate as substrate, 14CO2 incorporation into PHB was negligible. The results provide evidence that acetone is channelled into the intermediary metabolism of this strain via carboxylation to acetoacetate.},

  abstract = {The cardioselective muscarinic antagonist methoctramine antagonized carbamylcholine-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion in dissociated rat cerebrocortical cells. However, as the concentration of methoctramine was increased above 5 microM, there was a reversal of the antagonism of the PI response. In the absence of carbamylcholine, methoctramine by itself significantly increased PI hydrolysis with a maximal effect at 30 microM. Various classes of receptor antagonists, including atropine, and ion-channel blockers were unable to block methoctramine-stimulated PI hydrolysis.},
