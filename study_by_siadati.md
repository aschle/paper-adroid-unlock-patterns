#Fortifying Android Patterns using Persuasive Security Framework
persuasive secureity framework -  a set of principles to get users to behave more securely

1. Blinking starting point
2. EPSM continous feedback

* Participants - 270 from AmazonMTurk
* 60% chose strong passwords with blinking
* 77% chose strong passwords with EPSM

# Solutions:

* blacklisting (only shifts distribution)
* random assignment (cost usability and memorability)
* rearrangement (Uellenbeck e.g.)
* user education (later study)

This paper persuasive security authentication framework.
expanding the effective password-space.

# Efforts to increasing security can be categorized into two different classes
* increasing the theoretical pssword-space
* expand the effective password space used by the user

# Significant work:

* Background
* Rotation
* Layering
* Blacklisting
* random assignment
* rearrangement

(somehow they are missing to mention the study by Sun on password meters, why?)


# background on persuasive password security as an alternative approach

* Persuasive password security
* Persuasion for stronger passwords Motivation and pilot study
* Graphical password authentication using cued click points
* passpoints: design and logitudinal evaluation of a graphical password system
* persuasio as education for computer security

-> still need to read this und zusammenfassen

# pattern strength

* markov chains used from Uellenbeck
* categorizing patterns in 3 different levels of security: weak, medium, strong (equals 2-digit PIN, 3-digit PIN, 4/5-digit PIN)

# Limitations
* strong, medium, weak strenght measured with markov model, but training data is not clear, they only say: "We use an estimation of this probability instead, by collecting enough samples of patterns, using an appropriately designed experiment"

* they say that they compare security, memorability and usability of the interfaces
** security is done with markov model (weak, strong, medium), this is clear
** pattern lenght is understood as uability???
** memorability they just did not measure on MTurk!, but run study with 60 participants seperately, there is no difference beetween interface, but no study design in explained at all, 20 minutes was teste
** the way people perceive security (they found out doing a pre-study) and the way security is measured differs, is stays in conlflict to "people are already aware of which patterns are more secure"
** I think in-lab studyes do not reflect the real world, they also stated that after 30 minutes android phones lock, why test 30 minutes than, there is no explanation for that
