#Fortifying Android Patterns using Persuasive Security Framework
persuasive secureity framework -  a set of principles to get users to behave more securely

1. Blinking starting point
2. EPSM continous feedback

* Participants - 270 from AmazonMTurk
* 60% chose strong passwords with blinking
* 77% chose strong passwords with EPSM

# Solutions:

* blacklisting (only shifts distribution)
* random assignment (cost usability and memorability)
* rearrangement (Uellenbeck e.g.)
* user education (later study)

This paper persuasive security authentication framework.
expanding the effective password-space.

# Efforts to increasing security can be categorized into two different classes
* increasing the theoretical pssword-space
* expand the effective password space used by the user

# Significant work:

* Background
* Rotation
* Layering
* Blacklisting
* random assignment
* rearrangement

(somehow they are missing to mention the study by Sun on password meters, why?)


# background on persuasive password security as an alternative approach

* Persuasive password security
* Persuasion for stronger passwords Motivation and pilot study
* Graphical password authentication using cued click points
* passpoints: design and logitudinal evaluation of a graphical password system
* persuasio as education for computer security

-> still need to read this und zusammenfassen

# pattern strength

* markov chains used from Uellenbeck
* categorizing patterns in 3 different levels of security: weak, medium, strong (equals 2-digit PIN, 3-digit PIN, 4/5-digit PIN)
