# Quantifying the Security of Graphical Passwords: The Case of Android Unlock Patterns

* study with 584 participants and 2.900 patterns
* interviewd 105 people on what strategy they use to chose pattern
* 113 particiant as part of a game


## Related Work
* *password rules* have limited effects (cite: Komanduri:2011:PPM:1978942.1979321)
* graphical paswords, which have the potential to offer better usability because the human brain is particularly well-suited to remember graphical information
* graphical password are classified as *recall-based*, *recognition-based*, *cued recall-based*, andoird unlock is recall based (Biddle:2012:GPL:2333112.2333114)

## Study
* offensive and defensive patterns
* recall after 20 minute break
* study resulted in too strong passwords
* pen and paper study to collect data about real android unlock patterns (105)

## Study results
* starting point in corners 75% (pre study?)
* top left point 38%
* average pattern length 5.63 (I think for prestudy?)
* user study with 113 participants
* average length defensive pattern 6.59
* average length ofensive pattern 6.33
* top left point 43%
* security here means absolute password length

## Formal notation of strength
* Markov Model, training and test set, complicated
* training set and testset a subsetof defensive patterns 
* offensive set is additional training data

## Pttern stregth
* different approaches: resistance against a specific password cracker, distribution of passwords
* number of possible measues can be found in Bonneau (bonneau2012science)
* partial guessing entropy estimate
