# A Pilot Study on the Security of Pattern Screen-lock Methods and Soft Side Channel Attacks

* In this paper we present a pilot study on user habits when setting apattern lock and on their perceptions regardin what constitutes a secure pattern.

* Resulting in a behavior-based attack and a physical attack on graphical lock screen methods. 

* In most cases lock mechanisms are implemented either as a PIN or a password.
* called 'pattern lock'
* the number of possible patterns is 389,112 (Aviv:2010:SAS:1925004.1925009)

* differentiat betweet side channel attacks and psychological attact
* side channel are attacks that use information gained from the physical implementation of a security scheme
* psychological attacks detect user bias in PIN and pattern setting

In this paper we attempt to combine physical (traces of fingers on screen) and pychologial (heuristics about user set lock patterns).


## Analysing the following:
* average pattern length
* the number of direction changes when drawing patterns
* the start points
* end points
* sub-patterns with length one to four nodes.


## Background
* thorpe and Oorschot recommend password rules for DAS (1. Require a stroke count of at least ⌊ Lmax ⌋, 2. Disallow passwords having global reflective (mirror) symmetry (e.g., Class 1b), 3. Require at least one stroke of length 1.)
* some stuff on smudging

## pre - study with 144 participants
* first pattern easy to remeber, second user thought was secure
* 57% thought secure pattern is usable in every day life, 43% did not think so
* average pattern length: 6.64secure and 6.19easy
* number of directions chages: 3.57 and the average number of direction changes made in an easy pattern is 2.74
* 50% starting at to top left node (secure pattern)
* found some very often used sub-patterns, a lot left to right and top to bottom subpatterns
