# Of passwords and people: Measuring the Effect of Password-Composition Policies

* even th best guidelines for designing password-composition policies, are based on theoretical estimates or small-scale lab studies
* policies effect not only the password users create but also user behavior
* two part user study with 5000 participants on AmazonMechanical Turk

## Related work

* Proctor et al. found out stricter policies an make passwords harder to crack but also harder to create and remember, increasing minimal length was more effective than apllying content constraints
* when policies are to demanding people will adopt coping strategies which deduce security
* Vu et al. found that generating passwords from first letters of word from sentences reduces vulnarability to cracking but cost to memorability

##Results

### Users and Their behavior
* Failed Creation attemps (dictionary check was most difficult)
* coping with failur, with dictionary check user was not informed about why he failed, behaviour with two different strategies were found: (1) incrementally modifying the initial password, (2) changing directions entirely
* giving up on creating a password
* reusing passwords
* storing passwords
* remembering passwords

* dictionary checks also significantly increase user frustration
* more writing down  when having higher-entropy passwords

1. Adding numbers to passwords is thought to add little entropy is wrong
2. dictionary checks add much less entropy as expected
3. unexpectedly user typically create passwords that exceed minimum requirements, thus increasing password entropy
