## Graphical Passwords: Learning from the First Twelve Years

* For over a century, psychology studies have recognized the human brainâ€™s apparently superior memory for recognizing and recalling visual information as opposed to verbal or textual information [Kirkpatrick 1894; Madigan 1983; Paivio et al. 1968; Shepard 1967].
* We classify the types of attacks on knowledge-based authentication into two general categories: guessing and capture attacks. 
* Usability: As there has been essentially no coordinated work towards an accepted standard for evaluating the usability of graphical password schemes, nearly every system evaluated has been tested (if at all) using different crite- ria. This makes comparison difficult at best. (Target User, Tasks, Domains)

## Evaluation Checklist

(1) Are target users, domains, and applications clearly identified?
(2) Are evaluation parameters and the theoretical password space clearly stated?
(3) Does the analysis explain the effect of user choice on password distributions with
informed discussion of the effective password space?
(4) Doestheanalysisconsiderthefullrangeofattacksplausibleinthetargeteddomain
and application and how each attack fails or succeeds? Does a login session leak
more information than expected?
(5) At minimum, has a lab user study been done (or other types of studies with higher
ecological validity) with results compared to appropriate alternatives?
(6) Is password interference discussed (e.g., as informed by a user study)?
(7) Do the user study and security analysis use the same parameters?
