A Pilot Study on the Security of Pattern Screen-lock Methods and Soft Side Channel Attacks

Analysing the following: average pattern length, the number of direction changes when drawing patterns, the start points, end points and sub-patterns with length one to four nodes.

difference between male and female

average pattern length: 6.64secure and 6.19easy
number of directions chages: 3.57 and the average number of direction changes made in an easy pattern is 2.74
