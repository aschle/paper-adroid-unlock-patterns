* in theory android patterns is more secure than a 5-digit PIN scheme [1]

* but in practice th security decreses to that of a 3-digit PIN for at leas half of the users [1]

* 40% of android users are using Andoid Pattern to unlock their devices instead of a PIN (van2014studying) - ueberpr√ºfen!

* the first type of grid-based graphical passwords called "draw a secret"(DAS) was proposed by Jeremy et al. (Jermyn:1999:DAG:1251421.1251422)

* Tao et al. introduced Pass-Go that uses intersections of the cell in a grid (instead of the cells) and improved its usability

* android patterns is a type of Pass-Go system and widely adopted by Android users (van2014studying)

* Thorpe et al. demonstrated the llimitations of user selected patterns and effective password space of DAS ba analyzing the memorable space of graphical passwords where patterns are partially or completely symmetric, they conclude that effective password space of DAS is much smaller that theoretical password space (thorpe2004towards, Oorschot:2008:PMU:1284680.1284685)
